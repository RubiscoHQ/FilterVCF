# VarFilter
This is a tool used to filter [annovar](#)(http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/) annotated variants file. Annovar is a wonderful tool that annotate genome wide variants. You can specify rules and apply different disease models while filtering.

## Command
### -I —input \<file\_route\>
the file contain variants, if you just get vcf format, annotate it use annovar, or [wannovar](#)(http://wannovar.usc.edu/) (a web app interface of annovar). See test/test.annovar.txt for example, which is generated by wannovar, with suffix “.annovar”.

### -SI -sample\_info \<file\_route\>
the file contain samples’ information, should contain at least FamilyID, SampleID, Gender, Type, Father, Mother. See test/sample\_info.txt for example.

### -S -sample \<str\>
Filter variants using given sample ID, for multiple samples, use space to separate. Variant will be remained if only one given sample has it.

### -G -gene \<str\>
Filter variants using given gene name, for multiple genes, use space to separate.

### -R -region \<str num num\>
Filter variants using given region, format “chromosome start end”, like “chr2 1000 100000”. For multiple regions, use space to separate.

### -CF -column\_filter \<str str str boole\>
Filter variants using one column’s information in input file, format “column\_name logic query\_value na\_remain”, like “SIFT\_score ‘\>’ 0.5 T”.
- column\_name: the name of column corresponding to your input file.
- logic: should be one of [‘\>’, ‘\<‘, ‘=‘, ‘!=‘, ‘\>=‘, ‘\<=‘](#) (remember to add quotes) when query value is number, or one of [in, !in, include, !include, is, !is](#) when query value is string.
- query\_value: the value of this filter
- na\_remain: should be ’T’ to remain NA value (information not provide in the input file, usually remain blank or ‘.’), or ‘F’ to exclude.

### -M -model
Apply mendel's law to your input file, using the sample information provided by sample file. Should be [Dom, ResHom, ResComp](#), for multiple models, use space to separate.
For every families:
- ‘Dom’: Dominant, all patients carry and all healthy people don’t.
- ‘ResHom’: Recessive Homozygote, all patients are homozygote and all healthy people don’t.
- ‘ResComp’: Recessive Compound Heterozygote, for at least two variants on one gene, all patients are both heterozygote (but not homozygote, which is contained in ResHom) and all healthy people don’t.
